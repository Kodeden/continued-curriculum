# TypeScript (TS) Intro and Overview

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means that it wraps around JavaScript and adds additional features to the language. It is a language that is compiled into JavaScript. This means that TypeScript code is not run directly in the browser/Node. Instead, it is compiled into JavaScript code that is run in the browser/Node.

Above all, it adds type annotations to the language. It is a statically typed language, meaning that the types are checked at compile time, not at runtime. This is in contrast to JavaScript, which is dynamically typed, meaning that the types are checked at runtime.

The primary motivation behind using TS is overall developer üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª experience. When properly integrated into VS Code, we get _real-time_ feedback on some common mistakes that we might make in our code. This goes above and beyond linting, which is a static analysis tool that checks for syntax errors and style issues. TS can catch errors that would otherwise be caught at runtime, which is a huge win for developers.

By runtime, we mean that with plain JS, we would have to run the code and wait it for it to crash (think üí≠ `undefined.`) - _runtime errors._ JS lets us do pretty much whatever we want. It's very loose, which makes it easy to get started with but opens up the possibility for a lot of errors. TS helps us catch these errors before we run the code. With anything, there are pros and cons. Naturally, TS takes effort to learn and use, but it can save us time in the long run, especially on larger projects and/or when working with a team where not everyone can be intimately familiar with every part of the codebase.

Be warned ‚ö†Ô∏è, TS can also be frustrating at times and difficult. But, usually anything worth doing is! It's a tool that can help us write better code, but it's not a silver bullet. It's not a replacement for writing good tests, for example. It's also not a replacement for writing good documentation. It's just another tool that we must understand to use properly. Of course, whenever in doubt, consult the docs üìù and/or use ChatGPT, etc.

In the video, I also show the use of `gh`. Unlike most of the other content, you _don't_ need to actually follow along. I will be creating the template repo that we will be using for actually working with TS! Of course, you can follow along if you'd like, but it's about actually applying TS and a lot of this other stuff is just boilerplate.

Also, even though I created the repo on `KodeDen`, I forgot to add the `--clone` or `-c` _flag_ to simultaneously clone it! See [docs](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create).

## TS Template Repo Config üí©

For this section, you may wish to reference below if you prefer using the terminal to do stuff:

![Using the terminal](./images/cli.png)

Time for some 'busy work.' First, create a `.gitignore` _in the root of our repo._ Copy paste the standard Node project `.gitignore` from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore).

---

In `vscode/extensions.json`:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "mattpocock.ts-error-translator",
    "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next",
    "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker",
    "usernamehw.errorlens",
    "vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits"
  ]
}
```

---

In `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "addMissingImports": true,
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true
  },
  "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.wordWrap": "wordWrapColumn",
  "eslint.rules.customizations": [
    {
      "rule": "*",
      "severity": "warn"
    }
  ],
  "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
"typescript.inlayHints.parameterNames.enabled": "all",
  "typescript.inlayHints.variableTypes.enabled": true,
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled": "always",
  "typescript.validate.enable": true
}
```

Once you have completed the above steps, you may optional do: `rm index*` to remove üî• the demo code from the previous video.

Then, make your first commit:

1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "chore: :tada: initial commit"`

## `tsconfig.json`

[TS Config Video](https://somup.com/c0lDYrkh8n)

This configuration üîß determines how our TS gets compiled. There are way too many rules and settings to keep up with as TS has just grown and grown.

First, [watch this](https://youtu.be/eJXVEju3XLM?si=56huHiywtv0bHrt5).

Secondly, install a couple of üì¶s that we will extend from:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @tsconfig/recommended
npm install --save-dev @tsconfig/node-lts
```

Then create a `tsconfig.json` in _the root of your project_ and paste in the following:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@tsconfig/recommended/tsconfig.json",
    "@tsconfig/node-lts/tsconfig.json"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Base Options: */
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "target": "es2022",
    "allowJs": false,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "isolatedModules": true,

    /* Strictness */
    "strict": true,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false,
    "allowUnusedLabels": false,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,

    /* If transpiling with TypeScript: */
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,

    /* If your code doesn't run in the DOM: */
    "lib": ["es2022"]
  }
}
```

### Additional Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è on `tsconfig.json`

In a `tsconfig.json` file, when there are conflicting rules between the local configuration and the configurations imported via the `"extends"` field, the local configuration rules "win". This means that the settings defined directly in your `tsconfig.json` file will override any corresponding settings from the configurations it extends.

Here's how it works:

1. **Inheritance**: The `"extends"` field in `tsconfig.json` is used to inherit configurations from other `tsconfig` files. This allows you to base your configuration on a preset and then customize it further.

2. **Overriding**: If your `tsconfig.json` file specifies a configuration option that is also specified in one of the extended files, your local configuration will override the inherited one.

3. **Order of Resolution**: TypeScript resolves the configuration by first loading the settings from the extended file(s). It then applies the settings from your local `tsconfig.json`, overriding any duplicated settings.

This feature is particularly useful for maintaining consistency across projects while allowing for necessary customizations in each specific project.

For example, if you extend a configuration that sets `strict` to `false` but in your local `tsconfig.json` you set `strict` to `true`, your local setting of `true` will be the effective setting for your project.

Aside from that, if there are any settings in particular that you want to know about, you can consult the docs [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig). When doing so, you probably want to use 'command + f' to search for the setting you are looking for.

Of course, you can also ask ChatGPT or in our Slack channel.

Summarily, this is a file that you should be familiar with so that you can edit it as needed from time to time.

## `package.json`

Now that we have TS configured and we can run `tsc` to compile our TS into JS, let's add a script to our `package.json` to do this for us. Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tsconfig/node-lts": "^18.12.5",
    "@tsconfig/recommended": "^1.0.3",
    "@tsconfig/strictest": "^2.0.2",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  }
}
```

Above is what your `package.json` should look like after adding the `build` script. Don't worry about the exact version numbers shown above. They will change over time. The important thing is that you have the `build` script.

You can now run `npm run build` to compile your TS into JS. You should see a `dist` folder with a `index.js` file in it. You can delete the `dist` folder and run `npm run build` again to see it recreated.

### `--watch` Flag üö©

It's great that we can compile our TS into JS, but it's a bit of a pain to have to run `npm run build` every time we make a change. Luckily, we can use the `--watch` flag to watch our code and recompile it whenever we make a change. Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc --watch"
  }
}
```

Now, as you edit (and save) `src/index.ts`, `dist/index.js` will be updated automatically. This is a huge win for developer experience. It's a bit like hot reloading, but for TS. Just make sure that you are üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `npm watch`. Note that you can name that script whatever you want, for instance, `tsc-watch` or even `mickey-mouse` üêÅ üëÇüèæ.

If you got stuck, [this video](https://somup.com/c0XFoQgtuF) might help. Feel free to move on if you are comfortable with the above.

**Note:** If you emulate the code shown in the video above ‚òùÔ∏è, you will get an error for `console.log`. Don't worry about it for now.

### `@types`

Update `src/index.ts` to the following:

```ts
function add2Nums(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add2Nums(1, 2));
```

`console.log` will be marked with an error. TS will give some suggestion about `lib` settings. Basically, TS is not aware of what `console.log` is in Node. To fix this we will install the TS types for Node: `npm install -D @types/node`. That should resolve things. If not, exit out of VS Code and come back in.

Any time you install a package that's annotated with: `@types` you are installing type definitions for TS. This way TS knows "what's allowed" and what the various properties and methods are. Case and point, without defining the types for Node, TS doesn't know what `console.log` is. It's not a part of the language itself, but rather a part of the Node runtime.

Installing `@types` packages for various libraries is a common thing to do. For example, if you are using React (which we are not for now!), you will want to install `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`.

## Automatically üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the Compiled JS Code

Update `"scripts"` in `package.json` to the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc --watch",
  "start": "node --watch dist/index.js"
}
```

Really, you can make up your own names, but what's important is that we have `"build"` (or whatever) to compile our TS all the while watching it. And, we have `"start"` to keep watching and üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the compiled JS code ü§ì.

[This video](https://somup.com/c0XFoQgtuF) shows how it should work now.

## ESLint üö® and Prettier üé®

There's just a bit more work to add in our ESLint and Prettier tooling, and we cover that in [this video](https://somup.com/c0XFbXgtw1).

## Conclusion

Note that we didn't use Vite at all. That's because that is a tool for the browser, and not Node. In fact, we are not using any additional bundlers here. Just TS, Node, and some tooling. We will get to Vite and the browser soon enough, but for now, we are just focusing on TS and Node.

Generally, TS is for the benefit of developers and helps us catch some mistakes without having to run and crash the code.

Our code is compiled to JS with `tsc`. We can use `tsc --watch` to watch our code and recompile it whenever we make a change. We can also use `node --watch dist/index.js` to watch our compiled JS code and run it whenever it changes.
