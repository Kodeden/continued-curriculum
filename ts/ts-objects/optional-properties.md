## Challenge

Remember the ðŸš— challenge from [this lesson?](./ts-objects.md)

Let's add some optional properties to our `Car` interface. Your choice of properties, but make sure at least one is optional.

Please add and commit to your repo and inform your instructor via Slack DM. No video ðŸ“¹ is necessary this time.
