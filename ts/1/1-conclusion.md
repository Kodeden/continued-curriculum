# Conclusion

We are up and 🏃🏾‍♂️ 🤓. We have a nice template repo setup with '⌚ watch' functionality. We see that TS compiles to JS. And, we wrote our first meaningful TS code.

Note that in our example, TS is enforcing that we pass a string to the `greet` function. If we were to pass a number, we would get an error. This is a simple example, but it shows how TS can help us catch errors before they happen.

TS is there for the 👨🏾‍💻 experience. Wit the proper tooling in place (`tsc` along with a text editor that understands TS), we don't waste as much time 🏃🏾‍♂️ broken code.

As we will see writing quality, strict TS code is not always easy. In fact, some will argue that it is not worth it.

Nothing is perfect. There are tradeoffs.

As for us, we will always prioritize 'proper learning' and 'quality code.' In the real world, especially on some unstable projects, this doesn't always happen :(, and in the long run, it usually doesn't work out well.

Once 1️⃣ embraces TS, it's hard to go back.
