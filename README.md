# KodeDen Continued Curriculum

‚ö†Ô∏è This picks up where KodeDen's EduFlow left off. Don't look üëÄ here until you have completed all of the stuff in EduFlow first!

## Table of Contents

If you have come here after completing the EduFlow curriculum, you should have a solution for the Contacts Challenge with React Router. You've also started writing ‚úçÔ∏è some tests ‚úÖ for it. If you haven't, go back and do that first. Otherwise, the following content will guide you through the next steps, but you should theoretically be able to do this üí© yourself first.

### Testing ‚úÖ

1. [Testing the Contacts Challenge](./testing-contacts/testing-contacts-challenge.md)

### TypeScript üè∑Ô∏è

You should work through these in the prescribed order. It builds upon itself, and there will be challenge solution spoilers in later sections.

After each challenge, you should make a very clear commit message showing that you attempted/completed the challenge. This will help your instructor know how things are going.

#### Setting up a Template Repo

1. [TS Intro & Setup](./ts/ts-intro.md)
1. [TS + Vitest](./ts/ts-vitest.md)

#### Objects and Interfaces

Note that many of these challenges and concepts are based on the [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html). For a full understanding of TypeScript, you should read through that as well.
